    Most of the work that we do to help children and families in our community is currently supported by public agencies, private grants, and charitable gifts. This support helps to provide services for thousands of children each year, but many more are still waiting for help. You can make a difference. Your investment will ensure that Comprehensive Youth Services is there to provide the services needed to help children and families when they need it most.

        <h2>About CYS</h2>
        <li>OUR MISSION&#58;Comprehensive Youth Services of Fresno, Inc. is dedicated to providing a full range of prevention, intervention, treatment and educational services to help abused and at-risk children and their families.
        </li>
        <li>
              Since 1973, Comprehensive Youth Services (CYS), a 501(c)(3) community benefit nonprofit behavioral health agency, has provided quality mental health interventions and supportive services to underserved, at-risk and/or violence-exposed children, adolescents and families in Fresno and the surrounding communities. The agency’s primary goal is to prevent child abuse and neglect, to ensure the well being of every child/youth, and to aid in building stronger, more resilient families. 
           </li>
           <li>Services are available to all eligible individuals regardless of race, gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation or income level, and are entirely confidential. More than half of the services provided by CYS are delivered in the community – on school campuses, at resource or community centers, and in the homes of consumers.
